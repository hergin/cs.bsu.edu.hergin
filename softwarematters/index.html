        <p class="lead"><span class="font-weight-bold">BIO:</span> Dr. Jeffrey Carver is a Professor Computer Science at the University of Alabama. He is the Chair of the University of Alabama Cyber Initiative. He serves on the Alabama Commission Artificial Intelligence & Associated Technologies. He earned his PhD from the University of Maryland. His research interests include Software Engineering, Empirical Methods, Software Engineering for Research Software, and Human Factors. He is one of the primary organizers of the SE4Science Workshop series, focused on interactions between Software Engineering Researchers and developers of Research Software. He is a Senior Member of the IEEE and the ACM.</p>
        <p class="lead"><span class="font-weight-bold">TALK TITLE:</span> Software Engineering For Research Software</p>
        <p class="lead"><span class="font-weight-bold">ABSTRACT:</span> Increasingly research advances are enabled by Research Software (i.e. software that enables research in various disciplines). The characteristics of this software and the fact that the researchers who develop it are often domain experts but not necessarily software engineering (SE) experts, results in a need to understand how to identify and apply appropriate SE practices for high-quality and sustainable software. This talk focuses on work done to advance this understanding through surveys and case studies. The talk will also describe the efforts of an ongoing project to design a US Research Software Sustainability Institute (URSSI), which includes a number of workshops and a large-scale survey.</p>

        <p class="lead"><span class="font-weight-bold">BIO:</span> Dr. Huseyin Ergin is an assistant professor of Computer Science Department at Ball State University. He pursued his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Alabama. His research interests include software engineering, model-driven engineering, and model transformation. He worked in various industries as a software developer including the R&D department at Huawei Telecommunications, the IT department at Mercedes-Benz US International, a smart shopping assistant startup called Mona, and a wedding ring manufacturing company called Benchmark. His projects in these companies gave him an extensive look at the software development practices in various settings. He has been in the organization committee of successful local programming and robotics competitions and camps. Lately, he is closely working with industry partners on software engineering techniques and practices.

        <p class="lead"><span class="font-weight-bold">ABSTRACT:</span> Software is a crucial part of research in many fields today. However, software development is not an easy task. Primarily it is harder in fields where researchers are not formally trained to produce better software systematically. In this talk, we will share the results of a survey we have been conducting for the last ten months. The results of the survey will shed light on the software development practice in Operations Research (OR), reveal the relationship of the OR scholars with research software, and present the expectations and concerns of them regarding code and data sharing practices.</p>
